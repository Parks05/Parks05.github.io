## *Introduction:*
Nuclear Fission is 'A nuclear reaction in which a heavy nucleus (such as uranium) splits into two parts... which subsequently emit two or three nuetrons, releasing a quantity of energy equivalent to the difference between the rest mass of the neutrons and the fission products and that of the original nucleus.'^(Rennie, 2019)^
